Hash Verification Engine for PASS // FAIL

This file contains the core logic for checking if hashes match common passwords.

How it works:
1. Takes a hash (encrypted password) as input
2. Tries different hash algorithms based on the hash length
3. Checks each word in the selected wordlists b                # Skip remaining wordlists for this algorithm if we found all hashes in this length group
                if found_in_group[hash_length] == len(hashes_in_group):
                    send_status_message(
                        "",
                        False,
                        "#0f0",
                        [
                            ("âœ… Found all ", "#0f0"),
                            (str(len(hashes_in_group)), "#fff"),
                            (" hashes for ", "#0f0"),
                            (f"{hash_length}-char", "#ff0"),
                            (" length using ", "#0f0"),
                            (algorithm, "#0ff"),
                        ]
                    )
                    breakshing it
4. If the hashed word matches the input hash, we found the password!

Performance Optimizations:
- Early termination when ALL hashes in a list are found
- O(1) hash lookup using sets instead of O(n) list searches
- Cached hasher objects to avoid repeated object creation
- Duplicate password detection to skip already-tested combinations
- Smart algorithm ordering (most common first: MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Efficient file I/O with single-pass reading
- Per-algorithm group completion detection

This helps people understand if their passwords are too common and easily guessable.
